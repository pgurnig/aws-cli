## Introduction

`AWS CLI - Simply Presented` is a collection of scripts illustrating the power of the AWS CLI.

Scripts generally have two versions:

- basic: typically not idempotent; these scripts illustrate concepts cleanly and clearly with little or no error handling
- idempotent: includes some error handling; this also introduces some complexity, but is likely a better script
